# Libraries authored or adopted by Athan Clark

This listing aims to help me (or contributors) maintain and understand the library ecosystem I've either developed or adopted over the years.
It should be a thorough listing, and help decipher the dependency trees for the systems, to help upgrades and future-proof the projects.
